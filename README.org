#+TITLE: Biber: Crawl bib from CS conferences

* Install

You can install it as a racket package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
raco pkg install https://github.com/lihebi/biber
#+END_EXAMPLE

But currently I didn't expose cmd interface. So you will need to use
the APIs, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(require biber/bibgen
         biber/bib-write)
(parameterize ([BIBDIR "~/git/biber-dist/"])
    (gen-bib-and-write 'icml 2019)
    (gen-bib-and-write 'naacl 2019))
#+END_SRC

See main.rkt for more examples. I haven't tested using it as a package
though, so there might be some minor problems accessing the APIs.

You can also directly get the bib output from
[[https://github.com/lihebi/biber-dist][lihebi/biber-dist]]

Quantum Computing: TODO

For each of them, the package will manage
- crawl the website for a bib file list, for each year
- for each bib entry, figure out what is the pdf link
- download pdfs automatically, in background
- do all these at once

Also, I noticed that downloading htmls and pdfs from publishers
website is likely to be very slow, due to the visit limit of the
publishers. Thus, I might want to store a git mirror of all webpages
of these conferences. There might be copyright issues, but I think for
webpages that is fine.

The pdf cannot be mirrored: they are too large and has copyright
concern.
